Families can celebrate fall with the return of the gigantic pumpkin patch. Each weekend's activities 
will include hay rides, corn mazes, petting farm, the Moo Moo Cow Train pulled by an antique 
tractor, the Children's Garden, sunflower patch and a colorful new PumpkinLand.
Visitors can wander through the pumpkin patch to find just the right pumpkin. There is a special area 
of smaller pumpkins next to the children's maze. Pumpkin prices range from five dollars to eight 
dollars in the patch. The nearby farm store also offers ghost pumpkins, warty gourds, corn stalks and 
more.
